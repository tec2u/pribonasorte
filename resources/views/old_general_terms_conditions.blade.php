            Lifeprosper group depends primarily on the work performed by each individual, his personal turnover and the
            turnover of his group. These Rules and the Company's compensation plan may condition the Distributor's
            entitlement to the payment of financial performance upon the fulfillment of other requirements for the
            Distributor's activity.
            <br><br>
            2.1.5 The Distributor is obliged in all cases where his behavior and actions can be associated with the
            Lifeprosper group, to act professionally, to comply with all rights and obligations arising from these Rules,
            related annexes and documents, to follow the code of ethics and not to damage the good name and reputation
            Companies.

        <div class="line-content">
          <p class="text-content">
            2.3.1 Indirect Registration
            The distributor is not authorized to register persons to the Lifeprosper group without their knowledge or to
            register non-existent or fictitious persons. Any misuse of personal or contact data of third parties for the
            purpose of indirect registration is strictly prohibited.
            <br><br>
            2.3.2 Deliberately excessive purchases
            The system of purchase of Products by Distributors is set up in such a way that it assumes the purchase of
            Products only for the Distributor's and his immediate family's own consumption, the previous consumption of a
            larger part of the previously purchased Products and does not count on excessive purchases by Distributors
            into a disproportionate stock. The Distributor is therefore not authorized to place systematically oversized
            orders for Products or to purchase Products in a disproportionate supply in order to draw a higher commission
            or other financial performance. The company does not recommend indebtedness to the Distributor for the purpose
            of developing his activities in the Lifeprosper group.
            <br><br>
            2.3.3 Prohibited Recruitment
            The Distributor is not entitled to directly or indirectly offer other Distributors of the Lifeprosper Group or
            to encourage them to cooperate in any competitive activities with respect to the activities of the Lifeprosper
            Group, to switch to such other competitive activities or to terminate membership in the Lifeprosper.
            <br><br>
            2.3.4 Unauthorized Cooperation
            The Distributor is not entitled in any way to use the database of Lifeprosper Group Distributors or
            cooperating persons for his own profit or for the benefit of a third party, or to provide it to any third
            party. It is primarily prohibited to use contacts obtained in connection with activities in the Lifeprosper
            group to present any programs, opportunities, products or services other than the Products and opportunities
            of the Lifeprosper group or the Company; to establish, through these contacts, business relationships not
            related to the activities of the Lifeprosper group or to profit in any other way from the contacts and network
            of the Lifeprosper group in the sense of building business profit outside the Company.
            <br><br>
            2.3.5 Unauthorized Sponsorship
            The system of the Lifeprosper group allows taking over the sponsorship of a Distributor who is already
            registered in the network of the Lifeprosper group in the structure of another sponsor only with the express
            consent of the original sponsor and the new sponsor. If the original (direct) sponsor agrees to the transfer
            of the Distributor to another sponsor, this process is irreversible and it is not possible for this
            Distributor to belong to the structure of the original sponsor again in the future. Distributors are therefore
            prohibited from knowingly registering another already registered Distributor into their structure or even
            attempting to do so. Distributors are also prohibited from knowingly registering persons for whom 6 months has
            not yet passed since the termination of their previous membership in the Lifeprosper group.
            <br><br>
            2.3.6 Unauthorized Transactions
            The Distributor is not authorized to contact suppliers or other business partners of the Company without the
            prior written consent of the Company, especially, but not exclusively, for the purpose of establishing
            business cooperation outside the Lifeprosper group. Distributors are prohibited from conducting transactions
            with each other with Products or with other products and services traded within the Lifeprosper group.
            <br><br>
            2.3.7 Prohibited Distribution
            The Distributor is not authorized to mediate the sale of Products using other than the Company's official
            distribution channels (through the Distributor's subdomain or by registering a new member in the Lifeprosper
            group). This prohibition applies in particular to further commercial resale of Products through the
            Distributor's own distribution channels or another person with direct or indirect participation or influence
            of the Distributor on its decisions or activities (e.g. websites, e-shops, Facebook, Instagram, etc.).
            <br><br>
            2.3.8 Promotional Materials
            The Company is the exclusive originator of all marketing, advertising and graphic materials, photographs,
            documents, newsletters, as well as other communication tools related to the Products or the Lifeprosper group.
            The Distributor is not authorized to use other promotional materials or to procure his own for the promotion
            of the Products or his activities in the Lifeprosper group without the prior written consent of the Company.
            <br><br>
            2.3.9 Dissemination of false or misleading information
            Distributors are prohibited from spreading false, misleading or otherwise purposefully distorted information
            about the Products, the Company, participation, remuneration and opportunities in the Lifeprosper Group,
            regardless of the method of dissemination of such information and the medium used. If it is proven that the
            Distributor knowingly lies, in particular that he modifies information or falsifies documents, this behavior
            will be considered a serious violation of the Rules. The Company may terminate such Distributor's membership
            immediately without notice.
            <br><br>
            2.3.10 Unauthorized use of the "Lifeprosper" designation
            The Distributor is not authorized to use the designation "Lifeprosper" on any URL address, email address or
            profile name, different from the official channels of the Company, and also in any word connection with
            another designation.
            <br><br>
            2.3.11 No Exclusive Territory
            There is no reserved area or territory for the activities of the Distributor. The distributor is therefore not
            entitled to state or claim that it has exclusivity for its activity in a certain territory.
            <br><br>
            2.3.12 Systematic elimination of competition
            The Company does not approve of the Distributor, with the intention of building his own downline group,
            systematically targeting members of another company using the network marketing method and for this purpose
            encouraging them to violate the terms of cooperation with this company. The Company is not responsible for
            such actions of the Distributor.
            <br><br>
            2.3.13 Approval of Prohibited Conduct
            Any Distributor who witnesses a deliberate violation of these Rules is obliged to report this fact to his
            sponsor and, if this is not possible, to the Company directly. Approval of intentional violations of these
            Rules is prohibited.
            <br><br>
            2.3.14 Providing and spreading false information
            Any action by the Distributor leading to a reduction of trust in the Company's management, in particular the
            provision or dissemination of false information or the dissemination of false hoaxes (e.g. on Telegram,
            Whatsapp etc.) is considered a violation of the Rules with all the consequences thereof. A Distributor who
            commits the described behavior may have his membership terminated by the Company immediately, even without
            prior notice.
            <br><br>
            2.3.15 Promotion of competition
            In the interests of loyalty, building the good reputation and name of the Lifeprosper group, the Company and
            the Products, the Distributor is not authorized to speak publicly in favor of another MLM or other competing
            project, or otherwise actively support this competition, especially in the case of achieving the "LEADER1"
            position in the Lifeprosper group.

            3.1.1 Membership in the Lifeprosper group lasts until one of the facts occurs, as a result of which the
            membership changes or ceases.
            <br><br>
            3.1.2 If the Distributor's membership in the Lifeprosper group has been terminated, this person may
            re-register in the Company's system only after the waiting period has expired, which is 6 months from the
            termination of the previous membership in the Lifeprosper group.
            <br><br>
            3.1.3 In the event that the first purchase does not take place with the newly registered Distributor, this
            Distributor may be re-registered by a new sponsor, even without the consent of the original (direct) sponsor.
            Registration without a purchase is considered an incomplete registration, which does not bind the member to
            the first sponsor and their registration.
            <br><br>
            3.1.4 A member of the statutory body of a legal entity who is already a registered Distributor cannot be a
            Distributor at the same time. On the other hand, a legal entity whose member of the statutory body is already
            a registered Distributor cannot become a Distributor. Any such or similar chaining of distributors is not
            permitted and will be considered a duplicate registration, which the Company is entitled to cancel along with
            the created Account and assigned ID at any time without compensation.
            <br><br>
            3.1.5 It is strictly forbidden to enter the same billing information for multiple Accounts. In the event that
            the Company discovers such conduct, it is entitled to cancel all Accounts with assigned IDs that contain the
            same billing information, at any time and without compensation.
            <br><br>
            3.1.6 The Distributor acknowledges that all Distributors who are registered in the Company's system in a line
            below him have a separate contractual relationship with the Company, just like himself, and are thus not bound
            by the duration of his membership in the Lifeprosper group. The entire membership network of Distributors is
            built primarily in the interest and benefit of the Company, which bears witness to all rights to the database
            of its Distributors and the entire structure of the Lifeprosper group. The distributor is not entitled to make
            any claims on this database or structure.

            3.2.1 Any change in the Distributor's membership consisting in the sale, transfer or transfer of membership to
            another person is subject to the prior consent of the Company. The request for consent to the transfer of
            membership must be sent to the Company by one of the methods proving the Distributor's identity, i.e. by
            mailbox, in person, in writing or by email with a guaranteed electronic signature to the email address
            support@lifeprosper.eu
            <br><br>
            3.2.2 The Companies will assess each case of such membership changes individually, always with regard to the
            rights of the Company and other Lifeprosper Group Distributors. However, the company is not obliged to comply
            with the request.
            <br><br>
            3.2.3 The company most often accepts reasons for transferring membership, such as divorce, long-term illness,
            marriage, etc. A Distributor who requests consent to transfer membership is obliged to properly justify the
            request and substantiate it with relevant documents and the consent of the new Distributor.
            <br><br>
            3.2.4 All rights and obligations resulting from the contractual relationship with the Company are transferred
            upon the effectiveness of the transfer of membership to a third party, who becomes a proper Distributor upon
            acceptance of the change by the Company. The existing Account and assigned ID of the current Distributor are
            transferred to the new Distributor. The new Distributor must meet the requirements for becoming a member of
            the Lifeprosper group and must accept these Rules, including the related attachments and documents.
            <br><br>
            3.2.5 In the case of the transformation of the Distributor – a legal entity, as a result of which the existing
            legal entity is divided or its assets, property or parts thereof are transferred to several entities, the
            regulation in the transformation project is decisive for determining the transfer of membership. In case of
            doubt, the Company continues and recognizes as a Distributor a person who has the same ID number as the
            current Distributor. It is not allowed to divide or multiply one ID to several people.
            <br><br>
            3.2.6 The fact that the membership has been transferred does not affect the individual links in the structure
            of the transferred ID and does not result in a different arrangement of the Distributor network.

            entitled to exercise the membership rights of a deceased or defunct Distributor until the legal effect of the

            entitled, without any prior notification or warning to the Distributor, to immediately terminate the
            membership of the Lifeprosper group without notice times. The Company sends the notice together with
            information about the cancellation of the Distributor's registration in the Company's system to the e-mail
            address of the Distributor and his sponsor (the Distributor who is closest above him in his sponsorship line).

            3.4.4 Transition Period
            If the Company discovers or suspects that the Distributor has violated the obligations arising from these
            Rules, related annexes or documents, but the Company has not yet taken a decision on whether to terminate the
            membership of this Distributor, the Company is entitled until the adoption of this decision, but no longer
            than 2 months, limit or completely deny this Distributor access to his Account. During this transitional
            period, the payment of commissions or any other financial payments to the Distributor is also suspended. In
            the event that the Company subsequently decides to continue the membership of this Distributor, it will
            restore access to the Account and the Distributor will be entitled to payment of suspended commissions and
            other payments. However, if the Company decides to terminate the membership of this Distributor, The
            Distributor's account will be canceled without making it available again, and the Distributor will not be
            entitled to payment of suspended commissions or further performance. The Company will send the notification
            that access to the Account has been restricted or blocked and the payment of commissions has been suspended,
            as well as the Company's decision on the Distributor's continued continuation.
            <br><br>
            3.4.5 Settlement of Lapsed Membership
            In the event that the Distributor's membership is terminated, the Company will cancel the Distributor's

            claims or other benefits of the Distributor that are associated with membership in the Lifeprosper group, in
            particular the right to payment of commissions or other financial payments, cease. In the event of termination
            of membership, the Distributor is not entitled to any compensation, special remuneration or compensation for
            the created clientele or the built structure of the Distributors.
            <br><br>
            3.4.6 Re-registration after termination of membership due to breach of duty

            of these Rules may re-register in the Company's system only if the Company grants him consent for
            re-registration, after the expiry of the waiting period.
            <br><br>
            3.4.7 Internal blacklist
            The Company maintains a so-called internal blacklist for its Distributors, which is a nominal list of
            Distributors with whom the Company has terminated their membership by termination for breach of duty pursuant
            to clause 3.4.3 of these Rules. The Distributor acknowledges that in the event of termination of his
            membership in the Lifeprosper Group in the manner envisaged, he may be included in this list. In order to
            protect the Company, an internal blacklist is available for Distributors with an active ID.

            4.1.1 The Distributor is entitled to purchase Products for own consumption at discounted prices. The company
            is entitled to unilaterally change the prices of individual Products at any time without any prior notice. Any
            change in the price of the Products is immediately effective from the moment the change is reflected in the
            relevant distribution channel of the Company. In the event that the price of the Product is listed in an
            obviously incorrect manner, the Company is entitled to cancel the orders made containing such an incorrect
            Product price at any time, regardless of the payment of the order.

            or scheduled updates.
            <br><br>
            4.1.3 Each purchased Product has its own point value (PV), which is intended for calculating the amount of

            information necessary for its processing, the ordered Products are not currently in stock, or another fact
            occurs that prevents the proper processing of the order, the Company is entitled to delay the order or not to
            process it, until removal of such an obstacle. The company deals with such situations individually according
            to the circumstances of the given case. If an obstacle to the fulfillment of the order is a fact for which the
            Distributor is responsible and the latter does not remove it even after prior notification by the Company, the
            Company is entitled to bill the Distributor for the increased costs of fulfilling such an order.

            4.1.6 Ownership of the ordered Product is transferred to the Distributor upon its acceptance after full
            payment of its price. Payment of the price of the entered order can be made by bank card or transfer. In the

            order to avoid excessive purchases.
            <br><br>
            4.1.8 Products, including their price, are only available for the time they are displayed on the web interface
            of the Company's e-shop. In the event that the ordered Product is no longer available or is not being
            delivered or manufactured, the Company will immediately contact the Distributor in order to arrange the next
            procedure. In such a case, the company is also entitled to refuse or cancel the order.
            <br><br>
            4.1.9 Before sending the order, the Distributor is allowed to check and confirm the data he entered in the
            order. The distributor can cancel the order to the moment the order is sent, by phone or email. This does not

            4.1.10 In the case of the purchase of an individualized product, by sending the order, the distributor
            expresses his consent to the provision of personal data and their subsequent processing by the Company for the
            purpose of creating and archiving anonymous data records from information obtained by testing and analyzing
            the dried blood spot test and from survey questionnaires excluding sensitive personal information (names,
            dates of birth, residence) that would make the data personally identifiable. This information will be used by
            OmegaQuant Analytics, LLC, a South Dakota limited liability company, which guarantees data protection.
            https://omegaquant.com
            The distributor acknowledges that this anonymized data will be used for statistical data analysis, further

            5.1.4 Distributors are prohibited from disseminating claims regarding the therapeutic or healing effects of
            the Products that are in violation of relevant legislation (in particular Regulation of the European
            Parliament and of the Council (EC) No. 1924/2006 of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims in food
            labeling and Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on
            the provision of food information to consumers).

            5.1.5 Distributors are prohibited from disparaging any other competing product or project in any way, directly
            or indirectly, within the framework of the presentation of Lifeprosper Group Products and opportunities. In
            particular, the Distributor avoids comparisons or belittling that could be misleading or incompatible with the
            principles of competition and regulations governing unfair competition.
            <br><br>
            5.1.6 The Distributor is not authorized to present Products or opportunities of the Lifeprosper group or the
            Company together with any other programs, opportunities, products or services.
            <br><br>
            5.1.7 If the Distributor decides, during the presentation for the purpose of expanding the Lifeprosper group
            to include additional new Distributors, to publish statements of collected commissions or other rewards, or to
            allow access or preview to sections of the Account related to collected rewards or commissions, he is entitled
            to do so only in relation to his own the results achieved. If he wants to share the results of his upline, he
            is authorized to do so only with the express consent of a senior sponsor. The Distributor is obliged to
            publish only true results (see Article 2.3.9 of the Rules). In addition, to every communication in which the
            Distributor states his achieved results, he is obliged to attach the disclaimer below, sufficiently visible
            and in such a way that its connection with this statement is clear.
            Disclaimer:The activity of members in the Lifeprosper group, leading to the generation of possible income, is
            not considered a main employment relationship (HPP), but it is a business opportunity that can generate
            commissions as well as costs. This means that none of your future income in the Lifeprosper Group business can
            be promised, let alone guaranteed, as your overall success depends only on you and your determination to carry
            out this activity ethically, correctly and long enough. Rewards are calculated from your own work and from the
            work of members in the business network you are building. This means that if the turnover of your group is too
            low, or close to zero, then your commission will be zero as well. All your turnover is thus dependent on your
            willingness to learn, to get into this business correctly.
            <br><br>
            5.1.8 Distributors are prohibited from giving any radio, television, newspaper, tabloid, internet or magazine
            interviews, making public appearances, speeches or issuing statements relating to the Products, the
            Lifeprosper group or the Company without the prior written consent of the Company.

              conclusion of the purchase contract, in particular the costs of internet connection, the costs of telephone
              calls, etc., are paid by the buyer himself.
            </li>
            <li>
              The buyer orders the goods by filling out the order form. When placing an order, the buyer chooses a
              specific product, payment method and delivery.

            </li>
            <li>
              Before sending the order, the buyer is allowed to check and change the data he entered in the order. The
              buyer then sends the order by clicking the "send order" button. The seller considers the data provided by
              the buyer in the order to be correct. The condition for the validity of the order is the completion of all
              mandatory data and confirmation by the buyer that he has read the General Terms and Conditions and the
              Complaints Procedure and that he agrees with them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Immediately after receiving the order, the seller will send the buyer a confirmation of receipt of the order
              to the e-mail address that the buyer specified in the order. This confirmation is automatic and does not
              constitute a contract. The current terms and conditions are attached to the confirmation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The purchase contract is concluded only after the seller accepts the order, when this notification is sent
              by the seller to the e-mail address that was specified by the buyer in the order.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the seller cannot fulfill any of the requirements specified in the order, he will send the buyer an
              amended offer to the e-mail address specified in the order. This is not considered a new draft of the
              purchase contract - in this case, the purchase contract is concluded by the buyer's confirmation of
              acceptance of this seller's offer to the e-mail address: support@lifeprosper.eu

              If there was an obvious technical error on the part of the seller at the stated price of the goods in the
              online store, or during the ordering process, the seller is not obliged to deliver the given goods to the
              buyer, even if the buyer has already been sent an automatic confirmation of receipt of the order in
              accordance with these General Business Terms conditions. The seller informs the buyer about the error
              without undue delay and then sends him an amended offer to the e-mail address specified in the order. This
              is considered a new draft of the purchase contract, and the purchase contract is concluded in such a case by
              confirmation of acceptance by the buyer to the seller's e-mail address: support@Lifeprosper.com .
            </li>
            <li>
              The purchase contract is concluded in the English language, unless circumstances on the part of the seller
              or the buyer prevent it. It is possible to conclude the purchase contract in another language that both
              parties agree on. The concluded contract is archived by the seller in accordance with the relevant legal
              regulations for the purpose of its successful fulfillment, or for other purposes, and is not accessible to

            </li>
            <li>
              The seller does not require any advance payment or other similar payment from the buyer. Payment of the
              purchase price before the goods are shipped is not a deposit.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sell er issues a tax document - an invoice to the buyer, which he attaches to the goods and sends it to

            </li>
            <li>
              The choice of delivery method is made during the order entry. The goods are then delivered to the buyer:

                  to the address specified by the buyer in the order, via the carrier - Post office for orders in the
                  Czech Republic. Delivery abroad is used by the company Zásilkovna s.r.o. ( Packeta Group) – which uses

              is contracted on the basis of a special request of the buyer, the buyer bears the risk and any additional
              costs associated with this mode of transport.
            </li>
            <li>
              If, according to the purchase contract, the seller is obliged to deliver the goods to the place specified by
              the buyer in the order, the buyer is obliged to take over the goods upon delivery. If, for reasons on the

              have to accept the shipment from the carrier.
            </li>
            <li>

              or loss of goods passes to the buyer at the time of acceptance of the goods or at the time when the buyer

              (individual products of the seller).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="subtitulo-content"> 7. Withdrawal from the contract by the seller</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The seller is entitled to withdraw from the purchase contract especially due to the stock being sold out,
              the unavailability of the goods, or when the manufacturer, importer or supplier of the goods has stopped the
              production or import of the goods or the price of the supplier of the goods has changed significantly, or it
              is not possible to deliver the goods to the seller from the seller's supplier at the originally stated
              price, also in case of an obvious error in the price of the goods (i.e. prices clearly different from the
              usual price for this type/type of goods).

            </li>
            <li>
              For example, the wrong indication of the first three digits instead of four is considered obvious in the
              price of the goods; a lower price by one digit (e.g. one digit "drops out" when specifying the price); an
              obviously low price of the goods (e.g. a 50% lower price than is usual for this kind and type of goods,
              without indicating that the goods are a sale or another discount event); and other obvious typographical
              errors, obvious errors in the product description, image, etc.

            </li>

            <li>
              The seller immediately informs the buyer of the withdrawal from the contract via the e-mail address
              specified in the order and returns within fourteen (14) days from the notification of withdrawal from the
              purchase contract all funds, including delivery costs, that he received from the buyer on the basis of the
              contract, namely in the same manner, or in another manner, as he may determine.

            </li>

          </ol>
          <p class="subtitulo-content">8. Rights from defective performance</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The rights and obligations of the contracting parties regarding rights from defective performance are
              governed by Sections 1914 to 1925, Sections 2099 to 2117 and Sections 2161 to 2174 of the Civil Code and
              Act No. 634/1992 Coll., on consumer protection.

            </li>
            <li>
              The seller is responsible to the buyer that the goods are free of defects upon receipt. In particular,
              the seller is responsible to the buyer that at the time the buyer took over the goods:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  the goods have the properties agreed upon by the parties and, in the absence of an agreement, they
                  have the properties that the seller or manufacturer has described or that the buyer expected with
                  regard to the nature of the goods and on the basis of the advertising carried out by them,

                </li>
                <li>
                  the goods are suitable for the purpose that the seller states for their use or for which goods of
                  this type are usually used,
                </li>
                <li>
                  the quality or design of the goods corresponds to the contracted sample or model, if the quality or
                  design was determined according to the contracted sample or model,

                </li>
                <li>
                  the goods are in the appropriate quantity, measure or weight and the goods comply with the
                  requirements of legal regulations.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              The seller's liability for defects does not apply to wear and tear caused by normal use and to goods sold at
              a lower price for a defect for which a lower price was agreed.
            </li>
            <li>
              In accordance with § 2104 of the Civil Code, the buyer is obliged to inspect the goods as soon as possible
              after taking them over and make sure of their properties and quantity.
            </li>
            <li>
              The period for asserting rights from defective performance begins on the day the buyer takes over the goods,
              i.e. the day indicated on the purchase document.

            </li>
            <li>
              If a defect becomes apparent within six (6) months of receipt, it is considered that the goods were already
              defective upon receipt. The buyer is entitled to exercise the right from a defect that occurs in the
              consumer goods within twenty-four (24) months of receipt.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the goods, on their packaging, in the instructions attached to the goods or in advertising, in accordance
              with other legal regulations, the period during which the goods can be used is indicated, the provisions on
              the quality guarantee shall apply. With a quality guarantee, the seller undertakes that the goods will be
              suitable for use for the usual purpose or that they will retain their usual properties for a certain period
              of time. If the buyer justifiably accuses the seller of a defect in the goods, the period for exercising
              rights from defective performance or the warranty period does not run for the period during which the buyer
              cannot use the defective goods.

            </li>
            <li>
              Rights from defective performance are asserted by the buyer with the seller in person at the seller's
              registered office, in writing at the address of the registered office, in person at the warehouse located at
              Kulkova 8, 615 00 Brno during delivery hours (Monday to Thursday from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. and Friday from
              11:00 a.m. to 14.00).

            </li>
            <li>
              Other rights and obligations of the parties related to the seller's liability for defects are regulated in
              the complaints procedure, which forms an integral part of these General Terms and Conditions

          </ol>

          <p class="subtitulo-content">9. Out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In the sense of § 1820 paragraph 1 letter j) of the Civil Code and § 14 paragraph 1 and § 20d et seq. of Act
              No. 634/1992, for the protection of the consumer, the seller informs that with a proposal for an
              out-of-court settlement of a consumer dispute, the consumer can turn to the body for out-of-court settlement
              of consumer disputes, which is the Czech Trade Inspection, with its registered office at Štěpánská 567/15,

              conditions set by the relevant legal regulations.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of these terms and conditions precludes the consumer from taking
              his claim to a civil court.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="subtitulo-content">10. Final Provisions</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              All arrangements between the seller and the buyer are governed by the legal order of the Czech Republic. If
              the relationship established by the purchase contract contains an international element, then the parties
              agree that the relationship is governed by the law of the Czech Republic. This does not affect consumer
              rights arising from generally binding legal regulations
            </li>
            <li>
              The seller declares that he is not bound by any codes of conduct in relation to the buyer in the sense of

              The seller is not responsible for errors arising as a result of interventions by third parties in the online
              store or as a result of its use contrary to its purpose. When using the online store, the buyer must not use
              procedures that could have a negative effect on its operation and must not perform any activity that could
              allow him or third parties to interfere or use the software or other components that make up the online
              store and use the online store without authorization, or its parts or software equipment in such a way that
              would be contrary to its purpose or purpose.

            <li>
              The buyer hereby assumes the risk of a change in circumstances within the meaning of § 1765, paragraph 2 of
